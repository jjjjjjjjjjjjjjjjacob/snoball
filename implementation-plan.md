## üìù Implementation Notes

### Critical Requirements
1. **PDT Compliance**: Must be tested thoroughly
2. **Security**: All API keys must be encrypted
3. **Performance**: <50ms order execution
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for trading hours
5. **Audit Trail**: All trades must be logged

### Technology Decisions
- **Trade Server**: TypeScript with Bun (for speed and type safety)
- **Database**: PlanetScale for horizontal scaling
- **Cache**: Redis for session and market data
- **Queue**: AWS SQS for order processing
- **Monitoring**: DataDog or CloudWatch

### Risk Mitigations
- Implement circuit breakers for API failures
- Add rate limiting on all endpoints
- Create fallback mechanisms for LLM services
- Implement position size limits
- Add daily loss limits
