## 🔧 Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.0.23
- **Frontend**: React 19 RC, Next.js 14.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 alpha
- **Database**: PlanetScale (MySQL-compatible)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS, Lambda, Secrets Manager)
- **IaC**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Development Tools
- **Monorepo**: Nx 21.3.11
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Testing**: Bun test runner
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Set up local development environment**
   ```bash
   bun install
   cp .env.example .env.local
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Configure secrets in GitHub**
   - Add AWS credentials
   - Add PlanetScale tokens
   - Add Alpaca API keys
   - Add LLM API keys

3. **Implement trade server**
   - Choose between Rust or Go
   - Set up Alpaca WebSocket connection
   - Implement order execution logic

4. **Build authentication**
   - User registration flow
   - Secure API key storage
   - JWT implementation

### Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] AWS infrastructure provisioned
- [ ] PlanetScale database created
- [ ] Vercel project connected
- [ ] Monitoring/logging setup

## 📈 Metrics & Performance

### Build Performance
- Bun install: ~37s (initial)
- TypeScript compilation: Pending measurement
- Next.js build: Pending measurement

### Target Metrics
- Trade execution latency: < 50ms
- LLM analysis time: < 2s
- Dashboard load time: < 1s
- PDT calculation: < 10ms

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Peer dependency warnings**: React 19 RC version mismatch
2. **Trade server not implemented**: Core functionality blocked
3. **No authentication**: Security implementation needed
4. **Lambda functions empty**: Serverless functions pending

## 📝 Notes

- PDT compliance is fully designed but needs integration with live trading
- Database schema supports sharding for scale but needs PlanetScale setup
- CI/CD pipelines are ready but need secrets configuration
- React 19 features enabled but may need adjustments when stable release ships

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Can create user account and store encrypted API keys
- [ ] Can track PDT limits for accounts under $25k
- [ ] Can generate trading signals via LLM analysis
- [ ] Can execute trades through Alpaca API
- [ ] Can display real-time portfolio data
- [ ] Passes all security audits
- [ ] Achieves < 100ms trade execution latency
